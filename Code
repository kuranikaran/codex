Smallest palindrome Given an integer N, find the smallest palindromic number of N digits that is divisible by 7. 
A palindromic number is one which remains the same when its digits are reversed. Function description Complete the function solve.
This function takes the following parameter and returns the required answer: N: 
Represents the number of required digits in the palindrome Input format for custom testing Note: 
Use this input format if you are testing against custom input or writing code in a language where we donâ€™t provide boilerplate code. 
The first line contains T, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case: The first line contains a single integer N denoting the value of N. Output format Print a single line containing the answer.
